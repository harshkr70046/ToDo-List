<h1>✨ Built My First To-Do App Using JavaScript & Local Storage! ✨</h1>
<p>I’m excited to share my latest project—a fully functional To-Do App created using JavaScript. 📝 This app allows users to add, update, and delete tasks effortlessly, and I’ve also integrated JSON and local storage to ensure tasks persist even after refreshing the browser. 💾
<br>
This project gave me the opportunity to dive deeper into JavaScript concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and data storage. Understanding how to work with local storage using JSON was a game-changer, as it helped me implement a seamless and user-friendly experience.
<br>
<h2>Key Features:</h2>
<h3>✔️ Add and remove tasks easily.</h3>
<h3>✔️ Mark tasks as completed.</h3>
<h3>✔️ Data persistence with local storage (no more losing your tasks!).</h3>
<h3>✔️ Simple and responsive design for a better user experience.</h3>
<br>
This project was not just about coding—it was about problem-solving, debugging, and improving my skills. 💻 It also marks another milestone in my journey of mastering JavaScript and building real-world applications.
<br>
Looking forward to exploring more challenging projects and growing further as a developer! 🚀
<br>
What’s next? Maybe a full-stack version of this app! Let me know your thoughts or suggestions in the comments. 🌟
